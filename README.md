# Start the server

Run the following command from the _root_ of your graphql-server project:

```bash
yarn start
```

# Run Apollo Sandbox to test your query

We can now execute GraphQL queries on our server.
To execute our first query, we can use [**Apollo Sandbox**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer/sandbox/).
Visit [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser, which will open the Apollo Sandbox.
